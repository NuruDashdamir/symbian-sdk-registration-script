This CMD script is created for Symbian developers to use S60 SDKs without registration.  
It resets SDK Emulator trial time - after running this script your SDK will have 14 days trial again. So you need to run it again after trial period ends.

Tested on Windows XP, 7, 8.1 and 10 (both x86 and x64), it doesn't require any admin rights. But it won't work in Windows 11, because Microsoft removed "wmic" tool in Windows 11.  
Worked for all SDKs (S60v3, S60v3FP1, S60v3FP2, S60v5 and S^3). It will work for other similar Symbian SDKs, like Nokia N97 SDK.

Script is created by me, feel free to use, share and modify. You can add this to any online or local Symbian archive :)

Thanks to "nikita36078" for telling me Nokia SDKs registration info path in regedit. Thanks to "bent" who is the creator of EKA2L1 Symbian Emulator.
